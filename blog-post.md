Semantic HTML helps developers create web pages that are meaningful to both *search engines* and *assistive technologies*.  
This article explains how to implement semantic HTML step by step.


---

## 1. What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML uses tags that describe their meaning clearly.  
Examples: <header>, <main>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>.

Non-semantic tags like <div> and <span> don’t explain content purpose.

## 2. Why Use Semantic HTML?

✅ *SEO (Search Engine Optimization):*
- Helps Google understand your page better.
- Improves crawling and indexing.

✅ *Accessibility:*
- Screen readers can navigate easier.
- Compatible with WCAG and ARIA.

✅ *Maintainability:*
- Cleaner, structured code for developers.

---

## 3. Before vs After Example

*❌ Non-Semantic Example:*
```html
<div>
  <div>My Website</div>
  <div>Navigation</div>
  <div>Article content goes here</div>
  <div>Footer info</div>
</div>
